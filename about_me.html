                <div class="panel-body"><p>My name is Vache Baghdassarian and I am a self-motivated dynamic leader, passionate about finding creative solutions to drive progress, growth and improvements
                    in organizational environments. My strengths include effective communication, relationship building, management of employees
                    and organizations, and collaboration with multidisciplinary teams. My experience includes different facets from clinical care
                    and restaurant management. When I was in high school, I was elected to design and maintain my schools webpage as I was one of
                    the few students who was tech savvy at the time. During this time, I was acquainted with former UFC champion Tito Ortiz, and I
                    actually helped him with his website as well. I started to become more familiar with HTML and CSS when I took an introduction to
                    internet course at UCI as an undergrad. However, I did not pursue a career in this field as I was majoring in Psychology. I am now
                    a General Manager for a high volume restaurant in Newport Beach and seem to be hitting a wall. I would love to use my previous skills
                    and drive to contribute towards a career that I feel could be rewarding for myself and my future.</p>

                    In whichever field I decide to go into, I believe a career as a developer is going to be one of the best choices I will be making for my life.</p>
